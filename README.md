For the Spotify URL, I had to use [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#endpoint-get-track).
Server runs on Java thanks to [Lavalink](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink).
Lavalink Wrapper is provided by [Shoukaku](https://github.com/Deivu/Shoukaku).
Podcast API done by [podcast-index-api](https://github.com/comster/podcast-index-api).
The APIs were used to get the URLs or information to send in to Lavalink. ðŸŽ¶
